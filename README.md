EdgeDepth is a super-compact object detector and depth estimator designed for ultra-low-resource devices like microcontrollers. It delivers real-time detection with dynamic bounding boxes for measuring it's approximate depth, balancing accuracy and tiny memory footprintsâ€”perfect for edge AI applications where every byte counts.

Still working on it. Will create branch for the versions and may be discard old versions if needed as they are quite useless. For now, **EdgeDepthV2.1** works good, where the model is also quite compact (just 4,563 paramters, and it detects the object pretty well and also can estimate depth! I will do the details later.)

Work still in progess (and a whole lot to do), and the model is still not in a MCU deployable form. So, dear collaborators, you are welome to work on it!
