EdgeDepth is a super-compact object detector and depth estimator designed for ultra-low-resource devices like microcontrollers. It delivers real-time detection with dynamic bounding boxes for measuring it's approximate depth, balancing accuracy and tiny memory footprintsâ€”perfect for edge AI applications where every byte counts.
